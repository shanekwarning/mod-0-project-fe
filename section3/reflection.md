## Section 3 Reflection

1. In Section 3, we removed even more supports and pushed you to learn a bit more independently, read through technical documentation, and use your resources more. How did that feel?
  * I felt like I did well. 3.8/5. I had to rely on notes and going back to previous lessons
to find information. However this was easy to locate and understand due to the notes
I have taken.

  * At this time I appreciate having some of the supports removed. It is forcing me to be
self reliant, and commit some of these skills to memory or build a system that I can
find the information that I need.

2. Think of a web or mobile application you use regularly. Where is an example of a place that the developers probably use Arrays? Explain.
  * The application is called Easy Army. It helps build army lists for a game. There are hundreds of different options for each nation to take. This information is most likely stored in arrays. This is so that they do not have to individually log each different option and have
an individual call name for each.

3. In your own words, explain what an Array method is.
  * An array method preforms a function on an array.
4. What is the purpose of a loop? When we would use a loop in conjunction with array vs. without?
  * A loop is used to repeat a function without having to run a command each time. The
  loop will continue to run until it not longer produces a true statement.
  * We would use a loop in conjunction with an array when we run the same code for items
  the array. We can use a loop without an array if we want something done repeatedly.
  This could be a certain amount of time or infinite.

5. If you had to teach a 5 year old about loops, how would you explain it?
  * If I had to teach a 5 year old about loops I would start explaining it by using a
  circle. Even better maybe a revolving door. You can get in the door and go around and
  around as many times as you like until someone tells you to stop. A loop allows something
  to be done repeatedly.
6. What questions do you still have about Arrays and loops?
  * At this point the power potential seems enormous for loops and arrays and when I
  think of how a website or application uses them I struggle to conceptualize it on a
  large scale. The possibilities seem limitless, even from just the examples we have had
  in our Mod0 project. Is there a way to help picture this? Right now I am viewing coding
  as boxes, each box contains code that may then be used as a piece in a larger machine,
  like a cell that is part of a multi cell organism. Would this be a correct way of thinking?
