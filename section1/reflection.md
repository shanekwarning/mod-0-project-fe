## Section 1 Reflection

1. Regarding the blog posts in Part A, how do you feel about asking questions? Do you tend to ask them too soon, or wait too long, or somewhere in between?
  * I believe that I tend to wait too long before asking questions. I think this because I would like to try to find the answer out myself and typically will attempt to do so until I drive myself a bit crazy and may end up missing the needed information due to this.
  * I am equipped to ask questions and feel comfortable doing so in most cases however I try not to if I can help it. This is something I am going to work on while at Turing and outside of the program as well.
2. What are the data types you learned about in this section? In your own words, define each.
 * I learned about strings, numbers, and booleans.
   1. String, letter and other characters that are held inside qoutes.
   2. Number, simply a number no qoutes needed.
   3. Boolean, these equate to true or false statements.
3. How would you log the string `"Hello World!"` to the console?
  * console.log("Hello World");
4. What is/are the character(s) you would use to indicate comments in a JavaScript file? What is the purpose of a code comment?
  * The characters used are two back slashes, //.
  * The purpose of the code comment is when more explanation is needed to explain our reasoning and intentions of the code.
5. In your own words, what is a variable? How would you explain it to a 5 year old?
  * Variables are used to represent a data value they may change. If needing to explain it to a 5 year old you could use what they want for breakfast as an example. We have breakfast which is the variable name in this case but it is not always equal to the same variable value. What you want/have for breakfast may change.

6. Think of a site or app you use frequently. What are three variables that are probably used? Which data type would each of those variables probably hold?
  1. variable - numberOfLikes (Number)
  2. variable - commentFeild (String)
  3. variable - passwordLogin (Boolean)
7. In your own words, explain what concatenation is.
  * A concatenation is when you take data types and combind them using the + operator.
8. Think of a site or app you use frequently. Where do you think the developers used concatenation?
  * On discord when you start a new conversation it reads "Hello (User), this is the start of your legendary conversation with (name)"
9. What questions do you still have about the work we've done so far? (not having a question is not an option)
  * My current question is why would we use concatenations when we have interpolation? In my opinion Interpolation seems cleaner. What does the $ sign mean and why do we need it when creating interpolations?
